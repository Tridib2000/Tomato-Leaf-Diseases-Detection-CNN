# Tomato-Leaf-Diseases-Detection-CNN
This TensorFlow/Keras code trains a CNN to classify tomato leaf diseases using labeled images. It preprocesses data, builds a model with convolutional layers, and trains it using early stopping and checkpoints. The model is evaluated on validation data, with metrics like accuracy and F1 score, and makes predictions on random images.
