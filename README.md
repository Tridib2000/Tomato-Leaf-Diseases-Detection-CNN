# Tomato-Leaf-Diseases-Detection-CNN
1. Introduction and Importation of Libraries
The code begins by importing essential libraries required for the development, training, and evaluation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) aimed at the classification of tomato leaf diseases. The TensorFlow and Keras frameworks are utilized as the core deep learning engines, enabling efficient handling of image data and neural network construction. Furthermore, utility packages such as EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint are incorporated to optimize training by preventing overfitting and preserving the best model configuration. Visualization of model performance is facilitated by the inclusion of matplotlib.

2. Hyperparameter Initialization
In this section, fundamental hyperparameters are defined, including input image dimensions (256x256 pixels), batch size, and the number of classes for classification. These hyperparameters establish the foundation of the CNN by dictating the input shape, controlling the volume of data fed into the network per iteration, and configuring the output layer to handle multi-class classification, with 10 distinct disease categories in this case.

3. Dataset Path Specification
The dataset paths for training and validation are specified, pointing to directories containing images of diseased and healthy tomato leaves. Each class is represented by a separate folder within the directories, conforming to a hierarchical folder structure that aligns with the labels required for supervised learning. This setup is crucial for the image_dataset_from_directory method to correctly parse the data and assign labels based on the folder names.

4. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
This section establishes a comprehensive data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline using TensorFlow’s image_dataset_from_directory function. Images are preprocessed via resizing to uniform dimensions of 256x256 pixels, normalized by scaling pixel values to the [0, 1] range, and batched for efficient processing. Data augmentation is applied as a regularization technique to enhance model generalization. To optimize training efficiency, data is cached and loaded with prefetching using the AUTOTUNE option, ensuring that the data pipeline is not a bottleneck during training.

5. CNN Model Architecture Construction
The core of the model is a deep CNN architecture designed to extract spatial hierarchies from the image data. The architecture consists of:

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply learned filters to the input data, capturing local patterns such as edges and textures. Successive convolutional layers progressively extract higher-level features.
Max-Pooling Layers: Introduced after convolutional layers, max-pooling serves to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, retaining salient features while discarding less relevant information. This step also contributes to computational efficiency.
Global Average Pooling: A final pooling operation is applied to condense the spatial dimensions of the feature maps into a single vector, representing the global context of the input image.
Fully Connected Layers: The final layers are fully connected (dense) layers, responsible for mapping the high-level features extracted by the CNN to the output classes. The softmax activation function is employed in the output layer to provide class probabilities for the multi-class classification task.
6. Model Compilation
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, a widely adopted optimizer known for its adaptive learning rate mechanism, which accelerates convergence while maintaining robustness against noisy gradients. The loss function utilized is categorical crossentropy, which is optimal for multi-class classification problems, as it measures the dissimilarity between the predicted class probabilities and the true one-hot encoded class labels. Accuracy is employed as the primary evaluation metric, offering insights into the model’s performance during training and validation.

7. Callback Functions for Training Optimization
To enhance the model training process, several callback functions are integrated:

EarlyStopping: This callback monitors the validation loss, ensuring that training halts when no further improvements are observed. EarlyStopping mitigates overfitting by terminating training before the model begins to memorize the training data rather than generalizing from it.
ModelCheckpoint: This callback enables the model to save the best-performing weights based on validation performance, ensuring that the final model reflects the optimal configuration observed during training.
8. Model Training and Validation
The model undergoes training for a fixed number of epochs, utilizing both the training and validation datasets. The training process employs forward propagation to compute predictions and backpropagation to update the model's weights based on the computed loss. Throughout the training epochs, the model's performance is evaluated in real-time using the validation dataset, with metrics such as accuracy and loss being recorded for each epoch. This section is pivotal as it demonstrates how well the model generalizes to unseen data and highlights potential signs of overfitting or underfitting.

9. Visualization of Training Metrics
Upon completion of the training process, training and validation accuracy and loss curves are plotted using Matplotlib. These visualizations serve as diagnostic tools, allowing researchers to assess the convergence of the model. By examining the divergence or alignment between the training and validation metrics, insights into model performance, such as overfitting or underfitting, can be gained, informing potential adjustments to the model architecture or hyperparameters.
